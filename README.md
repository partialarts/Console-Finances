# Front End Bootcamp - Week 4 Challenge - Console Finances

## Description

The purpose of this project was to perform data analysis on the financial records of a company using JavaScript. 

The aim was to use the JavaScript concepts I've learned so far in a real world application - it also became apparent quite quickly that I'd need to do a fair amount of my own research in order to fulfill the brief.

`for` loops made up a large proportion of my code - I used these to add the total profit/loss figure, as well as to find the monthly and total overall changes in profit/loss.

I found finding the greatest increase/decrease much more challenging - for this I nested conditional `if` statements inside `for` loops. The `.push()` function was used to store the monthly changes in an array to allow this, which required some online research for the answer.

I spent some time organising the code once finished to ensure its readability, trying to group related objects together with clear comments.
